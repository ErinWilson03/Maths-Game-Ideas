FIX THE WHILE LOOP SO IT DOESNT BREAK THE CODE LOL





DICE GAME CONCEPT 
-Two dice roll on screen with either a "X" or "/" and the user types in the answer of the equation

Using Math.floor(Math.random() * 6); I can get a random number from 0-5 repsresenting the dice faces with 0 actually being 6

::::	Declaring Variables	::::
score = 0
dice1 = 0
dice2 = 0

//need an array to hold all of the images in their coressponding numbers

				::::	Explain the game	::::
PRINT 
"Click the 'roll' button to roll the dice and start the game
Each dice will show a random number, and you will multiply 		them to get the answer
 When you want to enter your answer, type it in the box and 	click the 'submit' button
 You will win the game when you hit 10 points!"

				::::	Starting the Game ::::
WHILE score<10 {

				::::	Rolling the dice for equation ::::
	dice1 = math.random * 6 + 1
	dice2 = math.random * 6 + 1

	equation = dice1 * dice2

				::::	Input and check answer	::::
	INPUT answer
	
	IF answer == equation 
		PRINT "Correct Answer! Next equation: "
		  score += 1
	ELSE 
		PRINT "Incorrect answer, pelase try again."
	 ENDIF
}

				::::	Ending the game	::::
PRINT "Congratulations! You got 10 answers correct!"#
PRINT "Do you want to play again?"
